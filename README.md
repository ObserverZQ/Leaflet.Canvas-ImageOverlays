# Leaflet.Canvas-ImageOverlays
[Leaflet](https://leafletjs.com/) plugin for displaying multiple [ImageOverlays](https://leafletjs.com/reference.html#imageoverlay) on canvas instead of DOM, boosting better performance and responsiveness when the map is being zoomed, moved or resized. Working with Leaflet 1.0.0 and above. Inspired by https://github.com/eJuke/Leaflet.Canvas-Markers .
