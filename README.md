# Leaflet.Canvas-ImageOverlays
Leaflet plugin for displaying [ImageOverlays](https://leafletjs.com/reference.html#imageoverlay) on canvas instead of DOM, creating better performance and responsiveness. Working with Leaflet 1.0.0 and above. Inspired by https://github.com/eJuke/Leaflet.Canvas-Markers .
